# The Forge Samples

Unofficial implementation of multiple rendering techniques using [The Forge](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge) rendering engine. Based on the repository [the-forge-glfw](https://github.com/rextimmy/the-forge-glfw) by Tim Barnes for ease of use.

Follow step by step tutorials for these samples on [learn-computer-graphics](https://learn-computer-graphics.com/rendering-techniques/).

## Build steps

### Prerequisites

You need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the project, and a C++ compiler which handles C++14.

#### Linux

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

#### Windows

To get the MSVC compiler, you need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (and not VSCode), and select C++ development during installation.

### Build and Run

You can handle the `CMakeLists.txt` in any way you like, here's some way to use it :

#### `Option 1: CLI`

If you are on windows you can run the `GEN_CMAKE.bat` file. Else you can also open a command line and run the following commands :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -A x64 -DD3D12=OFF -DVULKAN=ON
make
```

To run the project, go to the build folder and run the executable fo your wanted sample

#### `Option 2: Visual Studio`

Open this folder with the `CMake...` option in file->open on Visual Studio. Press `f7` to build and `f5` to run the project.

#### `Option 3: VSCode`

Use the `CMakeTools` plugin, build with `f7` then run with `f5` (but be careful to be on the right platform, there is a launch file for windows and for linux).

**Warning** : Currently there is a link error when building on windows with vscode
